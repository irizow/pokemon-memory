This is a memory game. It was made while following the Odin project when i was starting to learn React.
I decided to add some extra features with an API that gives you the current market value of every card.
It's a little bit nerdy but I grew up being a Pok√©mon fan so I enjoyed it. 
The project is not responsive on mobile because honestly I didn't have the time as it was a test project.
